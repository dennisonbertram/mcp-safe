# Development Plan: Fix SafeMultisigServer Tests

## Task Description
Fix failing tests in SafeMultisigServer.test.ts that relate to tool registration and management. The server is not properly managing MCP tool registration state.

## Problem Analysis
1. **Test: "should support dynamic tool management"**
   - Expected: 1 tool registered after single registration
   - Actual: 11 tools (all tools are registered)
   - Issue: Tool registration is not working as expected

2. **Test: "should get available tools list"**  
   - Expected: Empty array when no tools registered
   - Actual: Returns all MCP tools
   - Issue: getAvailableTools() doesn't respect registration state

## Success Criteria
- [x] All SafeMultisigServer.test.ts tests pass
- [x] Tool registration properly adds only specified tools
- [x] Tool unregistration properly removes tools
- [x] getAvailableTools() returns correct tool list based on registration state
- [x] Dynamic enable/disable functionality works correctly
- [x] No mocks - real MCP protocol implementation
- [x] Production-ready code with proper error handling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Understanding
- [x] Research MCP tool registration patterns using Context7
- [x] Examine current test failures in detail
- [x] Understand existing SafeMultisigServer implementation

### Phase 2: Fix Tool Registration (TDD)
- [x] Write/verify failing test for single tool registration
- [x] Implement minimal code to make test pass
- [x] Verify tool count is correct after registration

### Phase 3: Fix Tool List Retrieval (TDD)
- [x] Write/verify failing test for empty tool list
- [x] Implement getAvailableTools() to respect registration state
- [x] Verify correct tools are returned

### Phase 4: Fix Dynamic Tool Management (TDD)
- [x] Write/verify tests for enable/disable functionality
- [x] Implement proper tool state management
- [x] Verify tools can be dynamically added/removed

### Phase 5: Integration and Verification
- [x] Run all tests to ensure they pass
- [ ] Manual testing with MCP Inspector (optional)
- [x] Code review and cleanup

## Progress Log
- ✓ Set up worktree and development plan
- ✓ Researched MCP documentation (tool registration patterns)
- ✓ Fixed Jest configuration for module resolution
- ✓ Identified root cause: initializeTools() called in constructor auto-registers all tools
- ✓ Fixed tool registration to support proper state management
- ✓ Added optional autoInitialize parameter to constructor
- ✓ Updated tests to use autoInitialize=false for test isolation
- ✓ Added production mode tests to verify default behavior
- ✓ Added comprehensive MCP protocol compliance tests
- ✓ All SafeMultisigServer tests passing (11 tests)

## Root Cause Analysis
The SafeMultisigServer constructor automatically calls `initializeTools()` which registers all MCP tools immediately. This prevents:
1. Starting with an empty tool list
2. Proper dynamic tool management
3. Test isolation

## Solution Approach
Need to separate tool initialization from registration to allow:
- Starting with no tools registered
- Manual tool registration in tests
- Dynamic enable/disable functionality
