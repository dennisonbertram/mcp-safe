# Development Plan: Fix LocalBlockchain.test.ts Failures

## Task Overview
Fix 6 test failures in LocalBlockchain.test.ts using Test-Driven Development methodology with real local blockchain functionality.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 6 tests in LocalBlockchain.test.ts pass
- [ ] ProxyCreation event parsing works correctly
- [ ] Nonce management issues resolved
- [ ] Test isolation ensures no state conflicts
- [ ] Real blockchain interactions (no mocks)
- [ ] Production-ready code with proper error handling

## Failure Conditions
- Tests remain broken or flaky
- Mocked blockchain functionality used
- State conflicts between tests persist
- Event parsing issues unresolved

## Current Issues Analysis

### Primary Failures
1. **ProxyCreation Event Not Found**: TestUtils.deployTestSafe:131 fails to detect ProxyCreation event
2. **Nonce Management**: "nonce too low" errors during transaction submission
3. **Event Parsing**: Safe proxy deployment events not properly parsed
4. **State Conflicts**: Concurrent test runs interfere with each other

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research & Understanding
- [ ] Research Foundry/Anvil for local blockchain setup
- [ ] Research VIEM event parsing mechanisms  
- [ ] Understand Safe protocol proxy deployment events
- [ ] Document findings

### Phase 2: Test Analysis (TDD Step 1)
- [ ] Run existing tests to document exact failures
- [ ] Identify root cause of ProxyCreation event parsing issue
- [ ] Map out test dependencies and state management issues

### Phase 3: Test Implementation (TDD Step 2)
- [ ] Write tests for ProxyCreation event detection
- [ ] Write tests for proper nonce management
- [ ] Write tests for test isolation

### Phase 4: Fix Implementation (TDD Step 3)
- [ ] Fix ProxyCreation event parsing in TestUtils
- [ ] Implement proper nonce management
- [ ] Add test isolation mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure proper blockchain state reset

### Phase 5: Verification
- [ ] Run all tests multiple times to ensure stability
- [ ] Verify no state conflicts between tests
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup after each test
- [ ] Document any edge cases

## Technical Approach

### Event Parsing Strategy
- Use VIEM's proper event decoding mechanisms
- Ensure correct ABI for ProxyCreation event
- Handle event logs correctly from transaction receipts

### Nonce Management Strategy
- Track nonces per account
- Implement proper nonce increment logic
- Handle concurrent transaction scenarios

### Test Isolation Strategy
- Reset blockchain state between tests
- Use unique accounts per test when possible
- Implement proper cleanup mechanisms

## Progress Log

### [2024-08-27 16:23]
- Created git worktree at `/Users/dennisonbertram/Develop/ModelContextProtocol/.worktrees-mcp-safe/fix-local-blockchain-tests`
- Initialized DEVELOPMENT.md with task plan
- Next: Research and analyze current test failures

### [2024-08-27 20:45]
- Researched Foundry/Anvil, VIEM, and Safe protocol using Context7
- Switched from Hardhat to Anvil for local blockchain (faster and simpler)
- Successfully deployed mock Safe contracts to Anvil
- Fixed ProxyCreation event parsing in TestUtils using proper event topic handling
- Fixed TypeScript errors and import issues
- **Results**: 10 out of 11 tests now passing (up from 5 failing initially)
- Remaining issue: Multi-sig scenario test has state isolation issue (passes in isolation, fails when run with other tests)

## Review Feedback
(To be filled after code reviews)

## Notes
- All work must be done in the worktree
- Follow TDD strictly: write tests first, then implementation
- No mocks allowed - use real blockchain functionality
- Maximum file size: 200 lines
